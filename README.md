# QuizzApp

A pub quiz type of application where the user answers questions and the app counts the score and shows the user's progress with the help of a progress bar

# What I have Struggled With:

- incrementing the progress bar as the user progresses with the quiz questions
- implementing the Alert Dialog
- stopping the incrementation of the score and progress bar when the quiz reaches the end
- saving the user progress if screen orientation is changed from Portrait to Landscape


# What I have Learned:

- Android Activity Lifecycle (the different phases the app goes from launch to shutdown)
- The Model View Controller (MVC): what is and how to use it
- Escaping Characters
- How to Create and Work With: Progress Bar
- How to Create and Work With: Toast Messages
- How to Create and Work With: Alert Messages
